# Welcome


The purpose of this site is to disseminate relevant information about Ward 5 and UP. There are two main types of writings: "issues" and "notes." "Issues" will be a limited number of posts on more complicated subjects that will be updated over time. The idea is to get a better understanding of the issue. "Notes" are one-off short postings on a variety of topics.

Posts are be written by the Ward 5 Councilmember, David McGaughey. I welcome content / suggestions from you all.

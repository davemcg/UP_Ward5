    "contents": "\nIssue\nThe UP Town Council will soon (July 2021 or so) vote on whether to ban gas-powered leaf blowers as of January 1, 2023.\nMy position\nLean no (as of June 19 2021)\nSome background reading\nUP Policy, Rules, and Municipal Structure Committee statement: here\nAtlantic article on how and why DC banned gas-powered leaf blowers as of 2022: here\nDCist update on DC residents trying to push up the ban date: here\nWashington University post that briefly summarizes the air pollution impact (on all gas-powered yard equipment, not just blowers): here. “A 2011 study showed that a leaf blower emits nearly 300 times the amount of air pollutants as a pickup truck. Similarly, a 2001 study showed that one hour using a gas-powered lawn mower is equivalent to driving a car 100 miles.”\nThe resolution\nRead it here.\nThe relevant line is “BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2023, IT SHALL BE UNLAWFUL FOR ANY OWNER OR OCCUPANT OF REAL PROPERTY LOCATED WITHIN THE TOWN, OR ANY GUEST, EMPLOYEE OR CONTRACTOR OF SUCH PERSON, TO USE A GAS- POWERED LEAF BLOWER ON THAT PROPERTY.”\nPros for banning gas powered leaf blowers:\nGas-powered leaf blowers emit SUBSTANTIAL air pollution. Electric does not. Pollution is produced by electricity creation of course, but it is from an emissions-controlled power plant very far away. Essentially gas-powered blowers make the air worse for you and your neighbors, some of which suffer from respiratory issues.\nGas-powered leaf blowers emit SUBSTANTIAL noise pollution. You all know. You can hear it. From my brief Googling: gas blowers (at 50 feet) emit around 80-90db (which is in the “damages your ears” range) and comparable electric blowers emit around 60-70db (which is in the “maybe annoying” range).\nCons for banning:\nIn the short term, it will likely drive up cost of contractor yard maintenance.\nIn the short term, contractors may refuse to work in UP\nMy longer position\nPersonally, I think this should pass as written. But….I’m young (or middle-aged depending on your perspective), hand-rake my yard, and don’t usually pay contractors to do yard work. I understand many people do rely on contractors to keep their yard maintained. Our town has a lot of trees and a lot of leaves. It needs to be feasible for contractors to swap over to electric for the blowers by 2023. This I am unsure about.\nIf I could see some evidence / persuasive anecdotes that banning gas powered blowers would moderately (or less) drive up costs of leaf removal, then I would lean toward voting “yes.” I am just concerned that switching to electric blowers is not practical in the next 18 months. My brief Googling does not find many “contractor” grade blowers.\nWhat should I do as a neighbor and a member of a community right now?\nAsk your contractor right now to reduce (or even stop) the amount of blowing done in your yard. It seems like the “default” position of yard contractors is to spend 10+ minutes walking around blowing grass clippings around year-round. This is not necessary (unless the aesthetics are very important to you). If you have read this far you now know that blowing makes the air quality worse for you and your neighbors.\nFurthermore you can consider trying to switch to an “all electric” yard service company. Chevy Chase has made a list (I don’t know whether any of them service UP though…..). Gas-powered lawn mowers also use the same high pollution engine design.\nWe wore masks to make ourselves and our neighbors safer. We can make a similar gesture by reducing our gas yard tool usage.\nI DISAGREE, YOU MONSTER\nWell, email or call to me to let me know your opinion. I will say, as of today (June 19 2021), I have had approximately five “DO NOT PASS THIS” emails, one “I can deal with whatever the outcome”, and one “PLEASE PASS THIS” emails. And a whole bunch of informal “I don’t really care; this is boring me” conversations with random people.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nOur Town Clerk is Andrea. She told me she was hoping more town residents would sign up on the web page to get updates. I think she is right. Why should you? After all, the town writes and prints a newsletter that comes to your mailbox!\nWell - one important reason: time. The newsletter comes out once a month. Minutes of the town meetings that go into the newsletter have to be approved by the council. Then meet the printing cutoff. So essentially you are reading minutes (“what happened in the room”) that are 4-8 weeks old.\nIf you want to get council matter updates MUCH faster you can go here: https://www.upmd.org/list.aspx\nI suggest you sign up for the “Mayor’s Email List” as Mayor Carey generally sends out a Friday-before-the-Monday-Council-Meeting message that briefly covers what will be discussed at the upcoming meeting. There is always a public comment period near the start of the meeting (7:30 pm) to allow residents to have up to 3 minutes to give their opinion.\n\nIf you have more specific interests (for example “trees”) - you can sign up for Agenda updates for a specific committee like the “Trees, Parks, & Environment Committee”.\n If you want to influence legislation the best time to do it is at the Committee level. By the time a piece of legislation has made its way to the full Town Council the specific committee generally believes it is ready to be approved (otherwise why bother bringing it out?). So thus raising issues before it gets to the full Town Council will be more effective.\nRemember, all council meetings (either Committee or Council) are open to the public. You do not need to ask permission to show up. Depending on the specific Committee you can either take part in the full discussion or will be limited to speaking in the “public comment” portion of the meeting.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n2021-06-07\nHad a brief discussion with Mickey Beall (UP public works director).\nHere are my notes from our chat:\nThere is a new idea how to save money on the install (essentially drill a support instead of pouring a large foundation). But this would maybe save approximately $10,000 of the appoximately $100,000 install cost that we were last quoted. We also would have to restart the permitting process. It wouldn’t be as onerous this time. But still would take more time.\nAny new bridge has to be ADA compliant - so we can’t toss a narrow anything down.\nWe also can’t toss a bridge down like they do in the College Park metal dry ditch pedestrian bridges. Those would lift up and float away if it flooded. Which we know if a fairly likely scenario on Wells. Plus a stream with running water is a substantially more challenging environment for a bridge.\nLonger bridge won’t solve the problem either. The bridge would cost more and the installation cost would not change dramatically.\nBottom line: Mickey has spent 4+ years working on this and believes he has exhausted all angles. The cost is the cost. Essentially the council needs to decide: are these bridge(s) worth 100k each? Do we, as a town, find that a prudent use of our money? Is this something we value? Let me know what you think.\nOriginal post\nBrief stub to explain the current state of the Van Buren / Wells Parkway Pedestrian Bridge. Which Google Maps thinks is doing just fine.\n\nFrom my faulty memory, around 2016 it was pointed out that this bridge was in bad shape. This was confirmed by engineers. In fact, it was in such bad shape there was concern it could collapse. Thus, it was removed.\nPeriodically people (like me) ask “uh, where’s the replacement bridge?”\nHere, I will explain what I understand about this annoying situation.\nThe town bought two wooden bridges. We have them on hand.\nPermitting was required at three levels (Federal, State, and County). The latter was extremely challenging (apparently the bridges were missed in the 1990s era PG County Master Plan).\nAfter huge amounts of town staff time dealing with the three layers of permitting, the town bid the bridge install out. It came out substantially higher (around $110,000) than expected. The council, twice, voted it down.\nSo the bridge replacement process is currently … in bad shape. Maybe even dead.\nPart of the reason that the install was so expensive was the extensive amount of work required to not cause sediment and erosion issues in the stream bed.\nWith all we have learned, we may have to restart the entire process (including the part where we buy some bridges). A longer / larger bridge may cost more, but could save money on the install cost.\n\n\n\n",

As I understand there is no ADA accessibility, mold issues, and insufficient space for the public works employees. The lot that the building is on is challenging to work with as it is not flat and the metro system has a tunnel running underneath it.\n2019\nThe town council in 2019 commissioned a town hall renovation study from Arnold & Arnold. You can read it here. The price is … a lot. 4.2 - 4.7 is more than our yearly budget. Now, that is not how things are paid for (UP would likely take out a 30 year bond), but still. That is a lot of money. My understanding is that the public works committee is essentially starting over on the project as the needs have changed with the pandemic.\n2009\nJohn Tabori mentioned to me that in 2009 he commissioned a town hall renovation report from Ahman. From his memory he thought it would have cost about 2.4 million. Which had to be shelved as the 2008 recession disappeared all of the grant money the town was expecting. I’m currently (2021-05-10) trying to get access to this study.\n… later that day …\nAndrea found the reports. Here and here are the two PDFs she tracked down.\nDramatically oversimplifying the two (2009 and 2019) studies, I would say that the scope increased from 2009 to 2019. The 2009 plan essentially leaves the original building layout the same (but presumably fixed it up?), builds a small “transition” section whose purpose is to 1. hold an elevator to reach the second floor of the original Town Hall and 2. connect to the new building. The new building is a one story structure that holds a 1. large meeting room, 2. two offices, and 3. a kitchen.\nThe 2019 plan involves two new buildings. Obviously costs from 2009 won’t match 2019, but the extra building (and increased footprint) very roughly increases the building cost by one million and the property grading work by another million. Hence 2009 is approximately $2.3 and 2019 is approximately $4.5 million.\n2019 Concept 1, Option A\n\n2009\n\n\n(There’s no equivalent to the image above in the 2019 study)\n\n\n\n",

Not in the “traditional” sense, but because occasionally it rains so hard that the storm drain system cannot keep up. The problem spot is roughly between Pineway (at Clagett-Pineway) through the empty lot near 6924 Pineway, where it heads towards Guilford Run\nFloodfactor.com\n\nPerspective\nWhile this nice map shows us where the issues are in Ward 5, the surrounding region has FAR WORSE problems (e.g. Riverdale Park below Whole Foods and lower/east Calvert Hills)\n\nUP Role - April 2021\nFrom a conversation with Len Carey in April 2021, I learned that UP had recently discovered that some of the storm water piping was substandard and not under the control of PG County. Should the town be able to upgrade the piping, then responsibility of the storm drains can be transferred (town wide?) to PG County See the image below for the approximate location of the substandard piping. The storm drain here (Pineway at Clagett-Pineway) regularly drains very slowly under heavy rains. I would imagine that fixing the pipe here would fix this issue.\n\nDownstream\nFrom my own experience, under VERY (as in 2+ inches/hour) heavy rain events, Guilford Run can get backed up and the storm drains stop taking in water (or perhaps even go backwards….). This is likely because the pipe underneath Baltimore isn’t large enough. For the Ward 5 storm flooding issues to be aleviated, this also would need to be addressed (I assume with a Guilford Run holding tank and/or better flow underneath Route 1).\n2021 05 Update\nThanks for Carter for pointing this document / plan out. There has been a great deal of planning to deal with Guilford Run -> Calvert Hills already. With a fair amount of money spent, according to this document. However, the bulk of the project remains to be done.\n\nI’m not certain at what level (College Park / PG County / Higher?) this is being run at. I also need to figure out what the current status of the project is. Should “they” move this more to completion, it would benefit the Pineway/Ward 5 stretch.\n2021-06-07 Update\nSome new comments after talking with UP Public Works Director Mickey Beall.\nThe town owns seven sections of storm drains. Mickey does not want to own them. He recently had to spend $1800 to unplug one. His budget is not sufficiently flush enough to withstand too many of these surprises. No more sanitation puns I promise.\nIf we can bring the storm drains up to PG County (not WSSC, I was wrong) standard, we can give them over and then it is their problem. Bad news, is that this requires a lot of planning, permitting, and destruction / construction. Good news is that Mickey has already started on the planning and the costs will be 100% reimbursed by the county after we complete the updates.\nThe town will continue to flood until improvements are made outside our town. When 9 Ponds is done (within a couple of years?) this alone will reduce the Wells Run flood level by several inches.\nIn Ward 5, Mickey confirmed our flooding is caused by Guilford Run backing up. Mickey said that Pineway at Clagett-Pineway is only about a foot higher than Guilford. So we need the Calvert Hill project to be implemented. Mickey said he thought they were supposed to start this summer. Emphasis on supposed to.\nBottom line - anyone who has flooded in the near term should expect a repeat\n\n\n\n",

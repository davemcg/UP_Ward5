    "contents": "\nOur Town Clerk is Andrea. She told me she was hoping more town residents would sign up on the web page to get updates. I think she is right. Why should you? After all, the town writes and prints a newsletter that comes to your mailbox!\nWell - one important reason: time. The newsletter comes out once a month. Minutes of the town meetings that go into the newsletter have to be approved by the council. Then meet the printing cutoff. So essentially you are reading minutes (“what happened in the room”) that are 4-8 weeks old.\nIf you want to get council matter updates MUCH faster you can go here: https://www.upmd.org/list.aspx\nI suggest you sign up for the “Mayor’s Email List” as Mayor Carey generally sends out a Friday-before-the-Monday-Council-Meeting message that briefly covers what will be discussed at the upcoming meeting. There is always a public comment period near the start of the meeting (7:30 pm) to allow residents to have up to 3 minutes to give their opinion.\n\nIf you have more specific interests (for example “trees”) - you can sign up for Agenda updates for a specific committee like the “Trees, Parks, & Environment Committee”.\n If you want to influence legislation the best time to do it is at the Committee level. By the time a piece of legislation has made its way to the full Town Council the specific committee generally believes it is ready to be approved (otherwise why bother bringing it out?). So thus raising issues before it gets to the full Town Council will be more effective.\nRemember, all council meetings (either Committee or Council) are open to the public. You do not need to ask permission to show up. Depending on the specific Committee you can either take part in the full discussion or will be limited to speaking in the “public comment” portion of the meeting.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n2021-06-07\nHad a brief discussion with Mickey Beall (UP public works director).\nHere are my notes from our chat:\nThere is a new idea how to save money on the install (essentially drill a support instead of pouring a large foundation). But this would maybe save approximately $10,000 of the appoximately $100,000 install cost that we were last quoted. We also would have to restart the permitting process. It wouldn’t be as onerous this time. But still would take more time.\nAny new bridge has to be ADA compliant - so we can’t toss a narrow anything down.\nWe also can’t toss a bridge down like they do in the College Park metal dry ditch pedestrian bridges. Those would lift up and float away if it flooded. Which we know if a fairly likely scenario on Wells. Plus a stream with running water is a substantially more challenging environment for a bridge.\nLonger bridge won’t solve the problem either. The bridge would cost more and the installation cost would not change dramatically.\nBottom line: Mickey has spent 4+ years working on this and believes he has exhausted all angles. The cost is the cost. Essentially the council needs to decide: are these bridge(s) worth 100k each? Do we, as a town, find that a prudent use of our money? Is this something we value? Let me know what you think.\nOriginal post\nBrief stub to explain the current state of the Van Buren / Wells Parkway Pedestrian Bridge. Which Google Maps thinks is doing just fine.\n\nFrom my faulty memory, around 2016 it was pointed out that this bridge was in bad shape. This was confirmed by engineers. In fact, it was in such bad shape there was concern it could collapse. Thus, it was removed.\nPeriodically people (like me) ask “uh, where’s the replacement bridge?”\nHere, I will explain what I understand about this annoying situation.\nThe town bought two wooden bridges. We have them on hand.\nPermitting was required at three levels (Federal, State, and County). The latter was extremely challenging (apparently the bridges were missed in the 1990s era PG County Master Plan).\nAfter huge amounts of town staff time dealing with the three layers of permitting, the town bid the bridge install out. It came out substantially higher (around $110,000) than expected. The council, twice, voted it down.\nSo the bridge replacement process is currently … in bad shape. Maybe even dead.\nPart of the reason that the install was so expensive was the extensive amount of work required to not cause sediment and erosion issues in the stream bed.\nWith all we have learned, we may have to restart the entire process (including the part where we buy some bridges). A longer / larger bridge may cost more, but could save money on the install cost.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nTown Hall\n\nUP’s Town Hall is not in great shape. Need to get a tour from Mr. Beall to see for myself. As I understand there is no ADA accessibility, mold issues, and insufficient space for the public works employees. The lot that the building is on is challenging to work with as it is not flat and the metro system has a tunnel running underneath it.\n2019\nThe town council in 2019 commissioned a town hall renovation study from Arnold & Arnold. You can read it here. The price is … a lot. 4.2 - 4.7 is more than our yearly budget. Now, that is not how things are paid for (UP would likely take out a 30 year bond), but still. That is a lot of money. My understanding is that the public works committee is essentially starting over on the project as the needs have changed with the pandemic.\n2009\nJohn Tabori mentioned to me that in 2009 he commissioned a town hall renovation report from Ahman. From his memory he thought it would have cost about 2.4 million. Which had to be shelved as the 2008 recession disappeared all of the grant money the town was expecting. I’m currently (2021-05-10) trying to get access to this study.\n… later that day …\nAndrea found the reports. Here and here are the two PDFs she tracked down.\nDramatically oversimplifying the two (2009 and 2019) studies, I would say that the scope increased from 2009 to 2019. The 2009 plan essentially leaves the original building layout the same (but presumably fixed it up?), builds a small “transition” section whose purpose is to 1. hold an elevator to reach the second floor of the original Town Hall and 2. connect to the new building. The new building is a one story structure that holds a 1. large meeting room, 2. two offices, and 3. a kitchen.\nThe 2019 plan involves two new buildings. Obviously costs from 2009 won’t match 2019, but the extra building (and increased footprint) very roughly increases the building cost by one million and the property grading work by another million. Hence 2009 is approximately $2.3 and 2019 is approximately $4.5 million.\n2019 Concept 1, Option A\n\n2009\n\n\n(There’s no equivalent to the image above in the 2019 study)\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nNote\nSee the bottom of this post for updates\nWard 5 Flooding “Hot Spots”\nWard 5 floods periodically. Not in the “traditional” sense, but because occasionally it rains so hard that the storm drain system cannot keep up. The problem spot is roughly between Pineway (at Clagett-Pineway) through the empty lot near 6924 Pineway, where it heads towards Guilford Run\nFloodfactor.com\n\nPerspective\nWhile this nice map shows us where the issues are in Ward 5, the surrounding region has FAR WORSE problems (e.g. Riverdale Park below Whole Foods and lower/east Calvert Hills)\n\nUP Role - April 2021\nFrom a conversation with Len Carey in April 2021, I learned that UP had recently discovered that some of the storm water piping was substandard and not under the control of PG County. Should the town be able to upgrade the piping, then responsibility of the storm drains can be transferred (town wide?) to PG County See the image below for the approximate location of the substandard piping. The storm drain here (Pineway at Clagett-Pineway) regularly drains very slowly under heavy rains. I would imagine that fixing the pipe here would fix this issue.\n\nDownstream\nFrom my own experience, under VERY (as in 2+ inches/hour) heavy rain events, Guilford Run can get backed up and the storm drains stop taking in water (or perhaps even go backwards….). This is likely because the pipe underneath Baltimore isn’t large enough. For the Ward 5 storm flooding issues to be aleviated, this also would need to be addressed (I assume with a Guilford Run holding tank and/or better flow underneath Route 1).\n2021 05 Update\nThanks for Carter for pointing this document / plan out. There has been a great deal of planning to deal with Guilford Run -> Calvert Hills already. With a fair amount of money spent, according to this document. However, the bulk of the project remains to be done.\n\nI’m not certain at what level (College Park / PG County / Higher?) this is being run at. I also need to figure out what the current status of the project is. Should “they” move this more to completion, it would benefit the Pineway/Ward 5 stretch.\n2021-06-07 Update\nSome new comments after talking with UP Public Works Director Mickey Beall.\nThe town owns seven sections of storm drains. Mickey does not want to own them. He recently had to spend $1800 to unplug one. His budget is not sufficiently flush enough to withstand too many of these surprises. No more sanitation puns I promise.\nIf we can bring the storm drains up to PG County (not WSSC, I was wrong) standard, we can give them over and then it is their problem. Bad news, is that this requires a lot of planning, permitting, and destruction / construction. Good news is that Mickey has already started on the planning and the costs will be 100% reimbursed by the county after we complete the updates.\nThe town will continue to flood until improvements are made outside our town. When 9 Ponds is done (within a couple of years?) this alone will reduce the Wells Run flood level by several inches.\nIn Ward 5, Mickey confirmed our flooding is caused by Guilford Run backing up. Mickey said that Pineway at Clagett-Pineway is only about a foot higher than Guilford. So we need the Calvert Hill project to be implemented. Mickey said he thought they were supposed to start this summer. Emphasis on supposed to.\nBottom line - anyone who has flooded in the near term should expect a repeat\n\n\n\n",

There is an extensive amount of public discourse about what the town is doing, will do, and would like to do. This happens at the town meetings.\nImportantly, the notes for the meetings are TEXT SEARCHABLE.\nThe town meetings are of two basic types: town council (1st and 3rd Mondays of each month, beginning at 7:30pm) and committees (each with their own schedule, often monthly). All of these meetings are fully open to the public and as of May 2021 are held exclusively via zoom teleconference.\nA case study\nTo give an example of how to search the town web page to find information on what the town is doing, we will search the term “storm water.”\n\n In the search box you can put in a word or phrase (“storm water”). Then click the magnifying glass (or hit “return” on the keyboard) and you will get the time sorted results, split by section (where section is the specific committee or the town council).\n We see the top three hits (by date) are in the Town Council Meeting and the Development Overview Committee. You can then download either the Agenda (what will be discussed) or the Minutes (a summary of what was discussed).\nIf we download the Mar 11, 2021 minutes we see that the “Aspen, College Park” development has a preliminary plan of subdivision that has been approved and “Nick Speech talked about the re-engineering of the project’s stormwater handling. The County will not accept a fee in-lieu for stormwater management. They have included vaults to hold stormwater under each of the 2 buildings…”\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nOur New Garage\n\n4201 48th Street, Bladensburg, MD\nOne large bay. Enough space for a garbage truck and a pickup truck / car to be worked on simultaneously. Though if the main bay is in use (as it is below), then that red pickup is stuck until the garbage trucks is moved.\n\n~4000 square feet (sq ft) of interior space.\n~1500 sq ft of exterior space\nThe town was paying about $37,000 / year. When the long term lease ended (late 2020/early 2021?) the rate went up to about $44,000 / year. The town also paid the utilities.\nRough timeline.\nRougher because the process began before I was a councilmember.\nLate 2020/Early 2021, the town is informed that the 4201 48th Street garage that UP has been renting for the past ten years will not be available for another lease as the owner plans on selling the property.\nIn March 2021 the council is presented other options. The town of Hyattsville offers up their old garage. At about double our current rate for our existing garage and only offers a short-term lease. Two sites in College Park are modestly larger than the current site, but about 2.5X our current cost. One is substantially smaller and about the same price as we currently pay. The owner of our existing garage informs the town the will sell in about September on the open market, as for $995,000.\nThe town begins an exclusive (one on one) negotiation with the owner of the 4201 48th Street garage\nIn a closed session (June?) we (Mayor and council) are told that the town continues to look for alternative sites (for sale or rent) and has been negotiating back and forth. No good alternatives (within the price/size/distance constrains) have been found. The council urges the administration to work on back up plans should the negotiations fail.\nA few weeks later we are informed a deal has been reached at $825,000.\nThe town is notified in the Town Council meeting and with a flyer about the impending purchase.\nWe learn that we can use American Rescue Plan funds to pay for approximately $375,000 of the cost, meaning no mortage needed to be taken out. The town had already (last fiscal year) allocated $450,000 for the potential purchase.\nSo why are we buying it?\nUP has “in-sourced” the public works operations\nWe own our garage trucks. The garbage trucks are operated and maintained by town staff, including our own mechanic.\nThis requires a garage to maintain / fix our town equipment and the site also serves to store supplies and equipment (the garbage trucks, replacement trash cans, the leaf suckers, extra street signs, etc).\nThis is our best option, buy or rent.\nStoring extra stuffsWhy don’t we just out source the maintenance?\nWell, then we would be reliant on someone else to fix our stuff. In practice our Public Works Director (Michael “Mickey” Beall) has said this means that it can take days / weeks to get repairs done. Which means that the town would have to buy more garbage trucks / etc to cover the extra down time and thus require even more space to store the equipment. Our mechanic works full time to maintain all the town (including the police department) vehicles and equipment.\nIs this is a bad deal?\nIt doesn’t seem like a fabulous deal. I don’t understand the commercial market. We were told that the recent jump in home prices has been matched by the commercial market. Mickey told me he thought this garage was a useful size for many businesses and he wouldn’t expect it be difficult to sell the garage, should the town ever go in a different direction. In the end, this was the best choice available. The good news is that that we used a restricted pot of money to partially pay for it. We also control the site now, so there is reduced risk of “surprise” expenses (remember if we were to rent a different garage our best options looked like they would double our cost). The site has been inspected. The building (except maybe roof) is in good condition. Long term, I think this is a good move. The town is full-in on running the public works in-house and a garage is a core component of that approach.\nExtra lot for vehicle parking and storage of goods\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nDanielle Glaros presented on storm water projects:\nPG county has challenging topography for flooding because:\nPoor drainage\nLow lying\nWaterways everywhere\nBecause of this, PG county has stronger storm water management than the state of MD requires. Essentially every new development needs to control 100% of the run off. The MD standard is 50%. However, older developments have zero storm water management.\nOne interesting nugget was that because of these strong regulations new developments reduce the amount of run-off downstream.\nUP has two waterways:\nWells Run\nGuilford Run\n\nShe focused mostly on Wells Run. The 9 Ponds project will likely start within 6 months. Will take about a year to complete. Will be a pond with a path around it. Goal is to make a desireable amenity. Unfortunately trees will be removed to make the pond (designed to retain as many as possible and to replant new ones). The creek upstream of the pond will also be cleaned up to improved flow. Half of water than runs through UP / Wells comes from the PG Mall.Hopefully this will have a large impact for UP.\n\nGuilford Run has some storm water drain work to be done downstream of UP (east of Baltimore).\nMs. Glaros emphasized that water management needed to be managed where it was created. There are no magic bullets. We have to work to control the water we have with rain gardens, reducing impervious surfaces, etc.\nShe is introducing legislation to increase the amount of money the county will reimburse for on-property water control (rain barrels, rain gardens, pervious pavers, etc.).\nAmerican Rescue Plan\nThe town of UP will receive approximately $2.1 million from the US Government over the next two years. The first million will be received very soon. While this is free money it has restrictions on how it can be spent. Very briefly, it can be spent on climate change mitigation (storm water), broadband investments (internet), and COVID-19 mitigation (food banks / small business loans). The town (and committees) are still formulating how the money will be spent. Most of the money will likely go to storm water mitigation. The mayor of UP is looking into hiring a consultant to make a comprehensive Wells Run Watershed (which includes Hyattsville, UP, and Riverdale Park) storm water management plan. The money must be allocated for a project by 12/31/2024 and spent by 12/31/2026.\nWe bought a garage\nThe town of UP is buying the garage that we have leased for the past 11 years. Why? Three reasons:\nThe owner is selling it\nWe are unable to find an equivalent garage within a 20 minute (or even longer….) drive. Much effort was spent trying to “share” garage space with neighboring towns with little effect. The town is a touch salty because we thought we had a deal with Hyattsville….then the terms were changed.\nWe need a garage to fix and store our town equipment (there is a reason you don’t see garbage trucks parked at town hall….)\nThe town administrator (David Deutsch) and the town lawyer (Suellen Ferguson) have been negotiating for months. We have a deal at $825,000. $450,000 was allocated in the last budget for this expense. The remainder will be paid using American Rescue Plan funds, as apparently this is an allowed use of the money.\nThis is good news because:\nWe control a very important piece of infrastructure (a medium-sized garage) that is getting increasingly difficult to procure with the continuous development in the area. We literally were unable to find another equivalent garage (size / location / cost) for lease or sale.\nWe paid “cash” for it and this now frees up about $42,000 / year for the town that was going to the lease.\nWe can always sell it should our needs change\nOur inspections reveal no pollution or structural issues, aside from a leaking roof\nTown Head Notes\nAndrea (town clerk) would really like more town residents to sign up for relevant alerts (e.g. “News and Announcement”). I wrote why you should sign up here.\nDan (Treasurer) briefly summarized the 2020 spending (fiscal year ended 6/31).\nMickey (Public Works) said that the two storm water mini projects (permeable paving at 44th (?) and a rain garden at Claggett/College Heights) were looking great because either one would be enough to meet our PG County requirements. We could save money by doing one or do both and bank extra storm water credits.\nChief Baker had no crime to report. Thanks were given for the UP Town Police’s (and Park Police with their horses) role in the July 4th parade.\n\n\n\n",

New sidewalks being added on College Heights Dr, Clagett, Claggett-Pineway (and other roads off of College Heights Dr). Notably the roads will be narrowed to 26 ft. While not ideal, sidewalks will generally be right next to the road to reduce the number of utility poles that need to be moved and to protect mature trees. While not discussed the “far” side of Clagett-Pineway (closer to College Heights Dr) will likely be narrowed to 24 ft and parking removed from one side to reduce the amount of yard that will be taken, as this portion of Claggett-Pineway is already 26 ft.\nThe town will be hosting the first “Meadow Day” on July 24th!\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nIssue\nThe UP Town Council will soon (July 2021 or so) vote on whether to ban gas-powered leaf blowers as of January 1, 2023.\nMy position\nLean no (as of June 19 2021)\nSome background reading\nUP Policy, Rules, and Municipal Structure Committee statement: here\nAtlantic article on how and why DC banned gas-powered leaf blowers as of 2022: here\nDCist update on DC residents trying to push up the ban date: here\nWashington University post that briefly summarizes the air pollution impact (on all gas-powered yard equipment, not just blowers): here. “A 2011 study showed that a leaf blower emits nearly 300 times the amount of air pollutants as a pickup truck. Similarly, a 2001 study showed that one hour using a gas-powered lawn mower is equivalent to driving a car 100 miles.”\nThe resolution\nRead it here.\nThe relevant line is “BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2023, IT SHALL BE UNLAWFUL FOR ANY OWNER OR OCCUPANT OF REAL PROPERTY LOCATED WITHIN THE TOWN, OR ANY GUEST, EMPLOYEE OR CONTRACTOR OF SUCH PERSON, TO USE A GAS- POWERED LEAF BLOWER ON THAT PROPERTY.”\nPros for banning gas powered leaf blowers:\nGas-powered leaf blowers emit SUBSTANTIAL air pollution. Electric does not. Pollution is produced by electricity creation of course, but it is from an emissions-controlled power plant very far away. Essentially gas-powered blowers make the air worse for you and your neighbors, some of which suffer from respiratory issues.\nGas-powered leaf blowers emit SUBSTANTIAL noise pollution. You all know. You can hear it. From my brief Googling: gas blowers (at 50 feet) emit around 80-90db (which is in the “damages your ears” range) and comparable electric blowers emit around 60-70db (which is in the “maybe annoying” range).\nCons for banning:\nIn the short term, it will likely drive up cost of contractor yard maintenance.\nIn the short term, contractors may refuse to work in UP\nMy longer position\nPersonally, I think this should pass as written. But….I’m young (or middle-aged depending on your perspective), hand-rake my yard, and don’t usually pay contractors to do yard work. I understand many people do rely on contractors to keep their yard maintained. Our town has a lot of trees and a lot of leaves. It needs to be feasible for contractors to swap over to electric for the blowers by 2023. This I am unsure about.\nIf I could see some evidence / persuasive anecdotes that banning gas powered blowers would moderately (or less) drive up costs of leaf removal, then I would lean toward voting “yes.” I am just concerned that switching to electric blowers is not practical in the next 18 months. My brief Googling does not find many “contractor” grade blowers.\nWhat should I do as a neighbor and a member of a community right now?\nAsk your contractor right now to reduce (or even stop) the amount of blowing done in your yard. It seems like the “default” position of yard contractors is to spend 10+ minutes walking around blowing grass clippings around year-round. This is not necessary (unless the aesthetics are very important to you). If you have read this far you now know that blowing makes the air quality worse for you and your neighbors.\nFurthermore you can consider trying to switch to an “all electric” yard service company. Chevy Chase has made a list (I don’t know whether any of them service UP though…..). Gas-powered lawn mowers also use the same high pollution engine design.\nWe wore masks to make ourselves and our neighbors safer. We can make a similar gesture by reducing our gas yard tool usage.\nI DISAGREE, YOU MONSTER\nWell, email or call to me to let me know your opinion. I will say, as of today (June 19 2021), I have had approximately five “DO NOT PASS THIS” emails, one “I can deal with whatever the outcome”, and one “PLEASE PASS THIS” emails. And a whole bunch of informal “I don’t really care; this is boring me” conversations with random people.\n\n\n\n",

After all, the town writes and prints a newsletter that comes to your mailbox!\nWell - one important reason: time. The newsletter comes out once a month. Minutes of the town meetings that go into the newsletter have to be approved by the council. Then meet the printing cutoff. So essentially you are reading minutes (“what happened in the room”) that are 4-8 weeks old.\nIf you want to get council matter updates MUCH faster you can go here: https://www.upmd.org/list.aspx\nI suggest you sign up for the “Mayor’s Email List” as Mayor Carey generally sends out a Friday-before-the-Monday-Council-Meeting message that briefly covers what will be discussed at the upcoming meeting. There is always a public comment period near the start of the meeting (7:30 pm) to allow residents to have up to 3 minutes to give their opinion.\n\nIf you have more specific interests (for example “trees”) - you can sign up for Agenda updates for a specific committee like the “Trees, Parks, & Environment Committee”.\n If you want to influence legislation the best time to do it is at the Committee level. By the time a piece of legislation has made its way to the full Town Council the specific committee generally believes it is ready to be approved (otherwise why bother bringing it out?). So thus raising issues before it gets to the full Town Council will be more effective.\nRemember, all council meetings (either Committee or Council) are open to the public. You do not need to ask permission to show up. Depending on the specific Committee you can either take part in the full discussion or will be limited to speaking in the “public comment” portion of the meeting.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n2021-06-07\nHad a brief discussion with Mickey Beall (UP public works director).\nHere are my notes from our chat:\nThere is a new idea how to save money on the install (essentially drill a support instead of pouring a large foundation). But this would maybe save approximately $10,000 of the appoximately $100,000 install cost that we were last quoted. We also would have to restart the permitting process. It wouldn’t be as onerous this time. But still would take more time.\nAny new bridge has to be ADA compliant - so we can’t toss a narrow anything down.\nWe also can’t toss a bridge down like they do in the College Park metal dry ditch pedestrian bridges. Those would lift up and float away if it flooded. Which we know if a fairly likely scenario on Wells. Plus a stream with running water is a substantially more challenging environment for a bridge.\nLonger bridge won’t solve the problem either. The bridge would cost more and the installation cost would not change dramatically.\nBottom line: Mickey has spent 4+ years working on this and believes he has exhausted all angles. The cost is the cost. Essentially the council needs to decide: are these bridge(s) worth 100k each? Do we, as a town, find that a prudent use of our money? Is this something we value? Let me know what you think.\nOriginal post\nBrief stub to explain the current state of the Van Buren / Wells Parkway Pedestrian Bridge. Which Google Maps thinks is doing just fine.\n\nFrom my faulty memory, around 2016 it was pointed out that this bridge was in bad shape. This was confirmed by engineers. In fact, it was in such bad shape there was concern it could collapse. Thus, it was removed.\nPeriodically people (like me) ask “uh, where’s the replacement bridge?”\nHere, I will explain what I understand about this annoying situation.\nThe town bought two wooden bridges. We have them on hand.\nPermitting was required at three levels (Federal, State, and County). The latter was extremely challenging (apparently the bridges were missed in the 1990s era PG County Master Plan).\nAfter huge amounts of town staff time dealing with the three layers of permitting, the town bid the bridge install out. It came out substantially higher (around $110,000) than expected. The council, twice, voted it down.\nSo the bridge replacement process is currently … in bad shape. Maybe even dead.\nPart of the reason that the install was so expensive was the extensive amount of work required to not cause sediment and erosion issues in the stream bed.\nWith all we have learned, we may have to restart the entire process (including the part where we buy some bridges). A longer / larger bridge may cost more, but could save money on the install cost.\n\n\n\n",

As I understand there is no ADA accessibility, mold issues, and insufficient space for the public works employees. The lot that the building is on is challenging to work with as it is not flat and the metro system has a tunnel running underneath it.\n2019\nThe town council in 2019 commissioned a town hall renovation study from Arnold & Arnold. You can read it here. The price is … a lot. 4.2 - 4.7 is more than our yearly budget. Now, that is not how things are paid for (UP would likely take out a 30 year bond), but still. That is a lot of money. My understanding is that the public works committee is essentially starting over on the project as the needs have changed with the pandemic.\n2009\nJohn Tabori mentioned to me that in 2009 he commissioned a town hall renovation report from Ahman. From his memory he thought it would have cost about 2.4 million. Which had to be shelved as the 2008 recession disappeared all of the grant money the town was expecting. I’m currently (2021-05-10) trying to get access to this study.\n… later that day …\nAndrea found the reports. Here and here are the two PDFs she tracked down.\nDramatically oversimplifying the two (2009 and 2019) studies, I would say that the scope increased from 2009 to 2019. The 2009 plan essentially leaves the original building layout the same (but presumably fixed it up?), builds a small “transition” section whose purpose is to 1. hold an elevator to reach the second floor of the original Town Hall and 2. connect to the new building. The new building is a one story structure that holds a 1. large meeting room, 2. two offices, and 3. a kitchen.\nThe 2019 plan involves two new buildings. Obviously costs from 2009 won’t match 2019, but the extra building (and increased footprint) very roughly increases the building cost by one million and the property grading work by another million. Hence 2009 is approximately $2.3 and 2019 is approximately $4.5 million.\n2019 Concept 1, Option A\n\n2009\n\n\n(There’s no equivalent to the image above in the 2019 study)\n\n\n\n",

The problem spot is roughly between Pineway (at Clagett-Pineway) through the empty lot near 6924 Pineway, where it heads towards Guilford Run\nFloodfactor.com\n\nPerspective\nWhile this nice map shows us where the issues are in Ward 5, the surrounding region has FAR WORSE problems (e.g. Riverdale Park below Whole Foods and lower/east Calvert Hills)\n\nUP Role - April 2021\nFrom a conversation with Len Carey in April 2021, I learned that UP had recently discovered that some of the storm water piping was substandard and not under the control of PG County. Should the town be able to upgrade the piping, then responsibility of the storm drains can be transferred (town wide?) to PG County See the image below for the approximate location of the substandard piping. The storm drain here (Pineway at Clagett-Pineway) regularly drains very slowly under heavy rains. I would imagine that fixing the pipe here would fix this issue.\n\nDownstream\nFrom my own experience, under VERY (as in 2+ inches/hour) heavy rain events, Guilford Run can get backed up and the storm drains stop taking in water (or perhaps even go backwards….). This is likely because the pipe underneath Baltimore isn’t large enough. For the Ward 5 storm flooding issues to be aleviated, this also would need to be addressed (I assume with a Guilford Run holding tank and/or better flow underneath Route 1).\n2021 05 Update\nThanks for Carter for pointing this document / plan out. There has been a great deal of planning to deal with Guilford Run -> Calvert Hills already. With a fair amount of money spent, according to this document. However, the bulk of the project remains to be done.\n\nI’m not certain at what level (College Park / PG County / Higher?) this is being run at. I also need to figure out what the current status of the project is. Should “they” move this more to completion, it would benefit the Pineway/Ward 5 stretch.\n2021-06-07 Update\nSome new comments after talking with UP Public Works Director Mickey Beall.\nThe town owns seven sections of storm drains. Mickey does not want to own them. He recently had to spend $1800 to unplug one. His budget is not sufficiently flush enough to withstand too many of these surprises. No more sanitation puns I promise.\nIf we can bring the storm drains up to PG County (not WSSC, I was wrong) standard, we can give them over and then it is their problem. Bad news, is that this requires a lot of planning, permitting, and destruction / construction. Good news is that Mickey has already started on the planning and the costs will be 100% reimbursed by the county after we complete the updates.\nThe town will continue to flood until improvements are made outside our town. When 9 Ponds is done (within a couple of years?) this alone will reduce the Wells Run flood level by several inches.\nIn Ward 5, Mickey confirmed our flooding is caused by Guilford Run backing up. Mickey said that Pineway at Clagett-Pineway is only about a foot higher than Guilford. So we need the Calvert Hill project to be implemented. Mickey said he thought they were supposed to start this summer. Emphasis on supposed to.\nBottom line - anyone who has flooded in the near term should expect a repeat\n\n\n\n",

There is an extensive amount of public discourse about what the town is doing, will do, and would like to do. This happens at the town meetings.\nImportantly, the notes for the meetings are TEXT SEARCHABLE.\nThe town meetings are of two basic types: town council (1st and 3rd Mondays of each month, beginning at 7:30pm) and committees (each with their own schedule, often monthly). All of these meetings are fully open to the public and as of May 2021 are held exclusively via zoom teleconference.\nA case study\nTo give an example of how to search the town web page to find information on what the town is doing, we will search the term “storm water.”\n\n In the search box you can put in a word or phrase (“storm water”). Then click the magnifying glass (or hit “return” on the keyboard) and you will get the time sorted results, split by section (where section is the specific committee or the town council).\n We see the top three hits (by date) are in the Town Council Meeting and the Development Overview Committee. You can then download either the Agenda (what will be discussed) or the Minutes (a summary of what was discussed).\nIf we download the Mar 11, 2021 minutes we see that the “Aspen, College Park” development has a preliminary plan of subdivision that has been approved and “Nick Speech talked about the re-engineering of the project’s stormwater handling. The County will not accept a fee in-lieu for stormwater management. They have included vaults to hold stormwater under each of the 2 buildings…”\n\n\n\n",

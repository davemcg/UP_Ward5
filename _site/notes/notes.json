    "contents": "\nNew Mayor!\nCongrats to Ward 1 Councilmember Joel Biermann, our newly elected UP Mayor!\nWhy no posts for so long?\nWork busy\nLife busy\nCouncil budget season is just madness with 3+ hour meetings which turn my already squishy mind into mush\nMost important - STOP USING THE BLUE USPS DROP BOXES FOR CHECKS\nThere have been several cases in University Park where checks have been STOLEN OUT OF THE BLUE USPS BOXES. Apparently thieves have the keys and are ransacking the boxes for checks. This sucks. Stop using the boxes ASAP. We have two checks we sent recently which…haven’t arrived been received yet and we are nervous. This is a DC-region issue.\nIf you have sent a check please verify that the recipient has gotten it!\nBudget\nWe passed the budget on Monday May 16th.\nNotes:\n2 new police officers\nWhy? The town has been on 8 officers for many many years. 20? More? The increasing densification around us appears to be driving more incidents in town. The Chief has been running his officers ragged (denying or delaying leave granted) over the past year and has been spending more on overtime. The Chief has been concerned about delayed response times at night. While crime is low, there have been some troubling incidents. This was a tough vote - there was a motion to only hire one new officer instead of two, contrary to what the Chief and the Mayor wanted. This motion failed 4-3 (I voted against, which meant I essentially voted to hire two officers). In the end, I decided to trust the Chief when he said he needed them.\n\nTaxes are the same for you. You pay the same amount (at least to UP) that you paid last year. And the year before. I forget when the last tax increase was. Given the rampant inflation I think it will be difficult to continue to keep taxes level. Expenses have gone up fairly dramatically in some cases (gas). We are raising town employee salaries (by 3.5%, which does not come close to matching inflation calculated at over 6%). We have managed to keep taxes level because of increased revenue from the speed cameras and COVID-related emergency funds. Neither of which are long-term revenue streams.\nFactoid: UP gets about 30% of the total on your property tax bill. The rest goes to PG county / Maryland. If your tax bill is higher than last year’s, it is not because of UP.\nThe council requested and allocated money to install EV chargers at town hall and make the first tentative move to electrify the town’s vehicle fleet.\n$65,000 towards improving security at the town garage and evaluating improvements (roof and improve inside layout)\n$300,000 for two new pedestrian bridges. One to replace the missing bridge and the other to replace its very very old twin. I attepted to halve this amount as I argued we should only replace the missing bridge. This failed. $125,000 of the $300,000 comes from the state of MD as a grant.\n$300,000 for new tot lot equipment. $250,000 of this comes from a state grant.\nParking Enforcement: a few thousand has been allocated towards this. While nothing concrete has been set up yet, the idea is to begin some form of parking control. Not to raise revenue or harass UP residents parking the wrong direction…but as another means for the Chief to help keep track of issues. He has expressed concern that the town is considered a safe place to hang out or conduct “business.” On the west (Adelphi) side of town there has been persistent issues with cars from out of the town parking within UP.\nWard 5 Block Party\nI was hoping to organize one on Oakridge in May, but we we couldn’t make it happen (my wife co-directed Azalea Classic and budget time really increased the work load for me). Given the increasing COVID case counts (wear masks inside!) and the near entry of the summer heat wave, I am now planning on holding it in the late summer / early Fall.\nHere is what I need from you:\nSomeone to host a bounce house (a flat-ish front yard on Oakridge)\nSomeone to help collect funds for the bounce house (it should cost around $200)\nSomeone to set up music (either speakers with a playlist or a band?)\nSomeone to organize the pot luck (roughly coordinate who will bring drinks/snacks/plates/etc.)\nUpcoming issues for the year\nTree ordinance. I will vote for it - I think it is fairly modest in scope. Essentially if you have a big tree, you can’t cut it down without asking first. If you do, then you are fined. This is to help protect the stressed out tree canopy in town. On both sides of our house we lost all the large trees - one because an elderly resident became scared that the large trees would fall on her house. Her landscaping company was very happy to oblige. Another because a local developer decided to virtually clear cut the lot before getting permits to build a giant college housing object. Which….many years later is still not happening. I think the ordinance, if it existed at the time(s), would have helped. After each of the tree clearing incidents we lost large trees in our yard in high wind events - trees grow together and it is very stressful for large trees to suddenly be more exposed.\nParking - I don’t believe many details of this have been worked out. But obviously this could be a fairly substantial change to the streets if a “heavy” option is used. By “heavy” I mean the town would require a permit to park in town and visitors would require a temporary parking tag. I don’t have any idea where this is going right now but will keep you updated.\nShuttles. To briefly summarize, the town had a shuttle program. It was fairly expensive, costing around $100k / year (or about $105 per house a year) given it was used by very few residents (around 80 trips a day if I remember correctly). The full town revenue is around 3.5 million. Obviously programs like the police or the public works department cost far more - but everyone in town benefits from that. Mayor Carey shut down the shuttle when COVID happened - as it was unclear how to run the shuttle safely - and usage plummeted. One major issue with the shuttle system was that the size of them required a CDL license to operate, which made it more difficult to find drivers, especially given the part-time nature of the job. The Mayor also set up a “Transit Task Force” to evaluate the shuttle program. They produced an excellent report, which you can find here.\nI am the chair of the second transit task force. Which includes many town residents donating their time. We meet the second Tuesday of each month. Like all meetings, they are open to the public. We are to make a decision in the Fall. Around November we are to give a presentation and finish our report. I will tell you that, from my perspective, I am currently finding it difficult to justify re-starting the program given: 1. the fairly sparse usage of the program before COVID and 2. the dramatic decrease in commuting post COVID (the local metro stops have about 33% of their pre-COVID ridership right now). But we will produce our survey and distribute it. If we find that a huge amount of the town desires a shuttle program (with the accompanying costs) that would certainly be influential!\nWe have also asked the Town Administrator to work out what the costs of the program would be with a smaller (15?) person shuttle that would not require a CDL license.\nSome other shuttle-related tidbits:\nNo, random people can’t drive the shuttle.\nNo, volunteers cannot drive the shuttle. Unless a small number of people wanted to undergo training and etc etc for some unknown reason. But we aren’t running a shuttle program on the idea that residents will undergo training and donate their time to drive a shuttle around for 4 hours a day indefinitely.\nIf you are approaching this issue from a climate angle, then you could argue that removing car trips is highly beneficial. As I see it, if very few people use the shuttle (and thus it is driving around empty all day long) then it may not be very beneficial. Furthermore there are opportunity costs. $100,000 spent on a shuttle is money that cannot be used on, say, solar panels or EV police cars / public works trucks.\nOne thing that is fairly different from when the shuttle was started up is we now have a large scooter program.\nFrom what we have heard, the paratransit usage of the shuttle was modest and it appears that volunteers (with their personal cars) are handling paratransit requests without much strain.\nThere was widespread agreement that the previous shuttle route was … not optimal and was confusing to understand. A new shuttle program would have a new route.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n2022-03-07 Town Council\nMayor Notes:\n3/30 the Hyattsville Library ribbon cutting!\nUPCA is alive and is seeking event chairs and a president\n4/2 is the UPCA Yard Sale\nMayor has asked staff to open Town Hall to the public in the Spring.\nIn person council meetings with Zoom? Probably would happen with the incoming Mayor. Town Attorney Ferguson points out we can’t use the 2nd floor of town hall as not ADA compliant (Zoom doesn’t count).\nBiermann Notes:\nSustainability committee looking into making UP:\nMonarch Waystation\nBee City\nMore pollinator spaces\nAdvertising “No Mow May”\n\nApril 23rd: 10am Town Stream Clean (Town Field)\nJune 25th: Meadow Day 10-12\nTown Park Plan RFP: Make a timeline to finish comments\nMickey Beall:\nHe explained the council should allocate another $300,000 or so to finish the town infrastructure project.\nMoney was allocated for this project 3 years ago. Over the past three years, a few changes have happened that have increased the price tag:\nExpanded scope of sidewalk repair to take advantage (~ 350 homes) of cheaper original pricing\nPermitting is increasingly a challenge. The original hope was that the town would get approval to finish “Phase 2B” in October 2021. The town is still waiting for approval.\nIn the end the $2.6 million dollar project (original budget) is now $2.9 million. So there is a $329,292 overage from the original allocation from 3 years ago. In money term, about $100,000 is from doing extra work (fixing more trip hazard sidewalks) and about $200,000 is from increased costs of construction (inflation, essentially).\nThe town will likely use our reserve to pay for the overage\nThe bridge (near UP Elementary) will also get some cracks repaired. It has 10 years of deferred repairs and the Town thinks this is important we should get it done. While removing this from the construction would save $100,000 in the near term, I don’t like to idea of kicking the can of bridge repair down the road any further.\nThe council passed this request 6-0. Yes, paying more is highly annoying, especially as a lot of the fault seems to lie with the county level permitting process being slow. But given the rampant inflation we are living through, this is (in my opinion), a not-crazy cost overage. These repairs will put the town in a good position over the next decade and beyond, I hope.\nPublic Safety Subcommittee Meeting (2021-03-09)\nJust some quick costs that Mickey gave for various road “features.” Useful numbers to have in mind when thinking about requesting improvements to your own street:\n$14000 for a table top sidewalk\n$3500 speed bump\n$1000 blinking stop sign\n$5000 blinking speed sign\n$8000 blinking crosswalk (example in front of UP Elementary)\n$80 stop bar (the white line at each stop sign)\nWe on the public safety committee will ask the full town council to adopt a town wide 20 mph speed limit.\nDOC (2021-03-10)\n JC Penny at PG Plaza Mall getting turned into an apartment building. The developer will also extend Toledo Road through to Toledo Terrace (when you cross into the mall it isn’t really a road….just a mall parking lot exterior lane thing). I asked the committee to recommend that the full UP Town Council formally ask for protected bike lanes as the developer was proposing just putting some paint on the road for a bike lane. As I believe they are rebuilding Toledo Road, it seems like a missed opportunity. We are also going to ask for details on storm water management (their engineer was not on the call).\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nApologies\nAgain, it has been a bit too long since my last post (a month!)\nBrief Updates\nMurky water continues to be an issue in Wells Run (due to the development south of Northwestern High School). The town is aware and continues to work with PG county to get the developer to properly install runoff controls.\nLegislative request to the Maryland legislature for bridge replacement. The council authorized a request to get money matched for the pedestrian bridge replacement(s). The town has already spent a bit of money (on the bridges themselves) but has balked at the full replacement as the cost for the install alone was breaching six figures. This would be “free” money to the town, if the request was accepted\nThe town plans on buying our own traffic counters to quantify in-town traffic impacts\nThe speed camera on Baltimore Avenue will go live very soon (mid-March)\nVoting for Wards 1, 3, 7, and Mayor (Mr. Carey is term limited and, to the relief of his wife, will not be running) on May 3rd. Both voting by mail and dropoff. 1pm - 8pm in person voting. Same system as the last election.\nApril 4th cut-off date for new residents to register to vote.\nIf you previously lived in UP but moved, you must update your address.\nShuttle buses are to be sold. See further down for more details.\nArt in the Park (thanks to the Freemans and Groppes) was a big success last year - the council was happy to the last Saturday in September “Art in the Park” day.\nEngineering firm hired to address storm water issues (see below for more information)\nTraffic Factoids\nChief Baker reported that the 4300 East-West Hwy camera had 3,864,432 vehicle passes and the 7000 Adelphi Rd camera had 2,276,226 vehicle passes from September 12th 2021 to February 4th 2022. That napkin maths out to 15 to 25 thousand cars per day. In one direction.\nThe town continues to rake in money ($70,000 in January alone) from the automated speed cameras - I think we will comfortably “max” out our revenue intake from this program (we can keep no more than 10% of the total town budget). Again, the goal is not to fund another revenue stream, but to reduce vehicular speed around us.\nTransit Task Force II\nThe council has authorized sale of the “old” town shuttles. This is not the “end” of the town shuttle, but rather a chance for a pivot. The mayor has asked me to chair a “Transit Task Force II” committee - which will be composed mostly of town residents who have very kindly offered up their time. The goal of the committee will be to produce a white paper that covers a few topics:\nAssess future demand for local bus and para-transit services. Are there other or better options for each, such as micro-mobility, which will affect the future demands for them?\nShould the program be restarted, what should the route(s) be? We will have a purple line (so help us) and have other potential destinations to consider (College Park Academy, Whole Foods, UMD, Discovery District). How to equitably place the stops in town?\nPrioritize low to zero emission vehicle options\nEstimate start up and running costs\nWork with Town Administrator to identify potential start up grant sources\nPresent preliminary report in mid September and final report by early November 2022.\nThe generous members:\nEmily Alvarez\nMarya Link\nJoe Schultz\nMargaret (Maggie) Wessling\nCarol Weese\nDavid Tully\nStaff Liaison - David Deutsch (Town Administrator)\nHelping Hands Liaison - Linda Verrill\nStormwater\nThe council authorized the town to contract out to the engineering firm Rummel, Klepper and Kahl (“RKK”) to study storm water control options.\nThe council was a bit apprehensive at the lack of details delivered regarding deliverables or scope. We have been waiting for months about hiring a firm and at least I was expecting to get a bit more detail than “here is a contract full of boilerplate.” Most of the council inquiries were along the lines of “wait, what are we hiring them to do exactly??” and “how much will this cost??”\nThe mayor agreed to add a $50,000 spending cap to the contract. The mayor and TA Deutsch both made clear they understood our concerns and would be carefully monitoring the work of RKK.\nMy hope is that we will get a rough idea of what projects can produce a useful amount of storm water control at a cost rougly within the bounds of the ARPA (free federal funds) that the town has been allotted.\nThe town has a list of potential projects (many rain gardens) as well as the storm drain upgrade / install along Clagett-Pineway.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nBelated post\nYes, I got a behind schedule and have missed a few posts. So this is a catch-up post.\nCouncil\nAdelphi Road Sector Plan\nSoon MNPCC will meet to potentially pass the Adelphi Road Sector Plan. Guilford Woods is within this (very small) sector plan and the plan, as currently constructured, would place high density (in the 4 story or so range) housing in the woods. The town of University Park authorized a letter asking MNPCC to alter the plan to preserve the woods, improve the intersection at Adelphi/Campus Drive/University, ensure that any development at the Guilford Woods / Guilford Run headwaters not worsen flooding issues, improve public facilities, and pedestrian connections. The town will also ask for a pause* in the plan time table to properly implement our requests. I believe the towns of College Park and Hyattsville have similar concerns and will be sending similar letters.\nThe Mayor did say he thought it was unlikely a pause would be granted\nPlowing\nAfter the snow storm on January 2-3rd, Mickey Beall (Public Works Director) reported the town was 100% plowed by 5:30 on January 3rd. I can’t track it down right now but I recall getting an email from a PG county touting 80% of the county roads were cleared by January 5th.\nPublic Safety Subcommittee\nThe town staff requested a town-side set of parking changes to alleviate two issues:\nWalk offs (people parking, then walking away)\nTight turns / sections that impede town vehicles (mostly the garbage trucks)\nTwo requests were made for Ward 5:\nRemove all parking on North Pineway from Baltimore to Oakridge. I strongly recommended against this change as there is “college housing” with a large number of parked cars at the 6934 Pineway which 1. help slow traffic into the neigborhood and 2. would just push them to park further into Ward 5.\nRemove parking across from the Mews alley at Oakridge to help the garbage trucks make the truck out. I am communicating with the owners who are affected to ensure they are OK with the proposed change.\nPhase 2B\nThe sidewalks are to be added at Clagett-Pineway soon. If you received a strange letter from the SOLTESZ group about “A concept and stormwater management plan”…it is in relation to the sidewalks. Nothing nefarious. Thanks to the the resident who informed me about the … strange letter. So if you got one (because you are within a block of the sidewalk) do not be alarmed. I’ll talk with Mickey about getting more useful correspondence in the future.\n\n\n\n",

Expecting it in early December, which would be good as the town’s “rate” for the work will get more expensive starting Jan 1, 2022.\nNOT COUNCIL: Beall Run In\nWas chatting with Mickey and asked him about something that had confused me. The council has approved several drain connections underneath sidewalks. I was confused who was requesting these and who was paying for them. Apparently when the town replaces sidewalks, they ask whether the homeowner wants an existing drainage (sump / etc) pipe that exits onto/near the sidewalk routed underneath the sidewalk and exiting onto the road. The town is paying for these. Which costs (ballpark) around $300. This is two fold:\nEveryone hates having drainage onto the sidewalks, which freezes in the winter and thus makes the sidewalks hazardous\nIt was very hard to get a homeowner to agree, on very short notice, whether to pay for the piping.\nSo, if you see white lines being drawn on your sidewalk and know of some pipes that could benefit from being routed onto the road, please contact Mickey immediately. I noticed Ward 5/Pineway was marked up today.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThe Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, supported the development of the ARPANET, the first packet switching network in the US. The precursor to the internet.\nSo everytime we discuss the ARPA, my ears perk up. Except that this is the American Rescue Plan Act . Which is also important. But in a very different way.\nAnyways, this meeting had one of the first overarching discussions about apportioning the ~2.3 million the town will receive from ARPA over the next two years.\nWells Run\nCM Martha Wells had noticed that Wells Run had gotten murky. CM Wells and the Mayor, after much leg-work, got the developers of some upstream work at Adelphi / Belcrest to fix their silt fence and lay sod / mesh to help control runoff.\nARPA proposals (just proposals!)\nClimate Change and Resilience\n50% ?\n“We have a growing list of potential locations, including recent discussions relating to certain alleys in Town. We will retain an engineer to develop specific details for the various projects…..developing plug-in capability as the Town fleet and equipment migrate(sp?) to an electric future.”\n\nNon-profit support\n10% ?\n“In 2020 Council allocated $25,000 of the Town’s $171,000 CARES Act money to support area food banks…Council could direct a 10% allocation of ARPA for non-profit support. This approximate $250,000 would be a great boost for programs serving people with ongoing needs in the region”\n\nIncrease pay for town employees\n“An allocation of approximately $200,000 would cover a $2.50 per hour temporary increase in pay for two years for our front- line employees, including public works and police (twenty employees maximum). A $104,000 annual cost per year would provide a $5,200 increase per year for eligible employees. This allocation addresses the ongoing need to remain competitive in police salaries, and it also fulfills the ARPA mandate to include workers who represent lower wage categories within the Town organization. With Council’s concurrence this program could begin with the first payroll in January, 2022.”\n\n“The recommendations above account for approximately $1,750,000 of the Town’s ARPA allocation. This total still yields a balance of $450,000 for future allocation.”\nIf you have suggestions - then now is the time to bother me. Very roughly, the money can only be spent on climate resilience, broadband, and COVID-related stuff.\n(Re)districting\nIn ugly politics news, the PG County Council passed a surprise redistricting plan that dramatically altered our area. College Park would be tossed into District 1 (with Laurel?!). Among other bits of local areas getting flung about. The four against (including our local council members) were horrified that a dramatic alteration of our political map would happen with literally zero notice or public input. In what-must-be-a-total-coincidence this redistricting would disrupt several in-progress campaigns and help certain council members.\nWhile there may (????) be valid reasons for re-configuring the map, the county council has not deemed us worthy of those reasons.\nThe council authorized the Mayor to send a letter voicing our disapproval to the county leadership.\nUnfortunately the letter had little effect as just tonight (10/19) the council again forwarded the map, with few changes.\nGuilford Woods\nThe DOC disapproves of the proposed land transfer from UMD to Gilbance. Council asked that the Mayor and CM Wells follow up with Senator Pinsky about how to most effectively communicate our message, as the transfer takes place at the state level. This is not something the town is familiar with.\nParking Sticker\nUPMD.org page has now a link to request a “UP” parking sticker for you car. Not required, but the police like them as it helps them quickly see who is a resident.\nParking Permit & UP Sticker Request Form\nPolice Chief Baker\nnot many seem to know that the town reimburses (up to $100) for security systems (Home Security System Rebate Form)\nsgrady@upmd.org is a notary and has been trained in car seat installation\nOverall, many of the town employees are notaries….too many for me to keep track of. Perhaps email our Town Clerk Andrea if you need notary services?\nMickey Beall\nstill working on permitting for “Phase2b” sidewalk install on Clagett Pineway / etc.\nElectric charging on Queen’s Chapel Road: Updated electric panel. 3 online as of today (1 fixed recently). Remaining 3 should be up soon (when some parts come in). Level 2 chargers.\ncompost program is 10 years old! Nearly 40% of town now uses it.\n\n\n\n",

Limited number of kids in virtual.\nLittle COVID spread in PG school system\nVery short of bus drivers (started 100 short, now 200 short!!!)\nHoping for a July 2023 finish for Hyattsville Middle re-construction\nPTA concerned about external module / trailers at UPES - trying to improve the appearance\nBoundary initiative - will begin 2023/2024 school year\nMeadow Work\nOn October 16, from 10-12, there will be volunteer work to feed and re-weed the UP town meadow\nTake Backs\nI believe these run from 10am - 4pm.\n10/23 paint/electronic recycling, paper shredding (UPES)\n10/23 drug take-back (town hall)\nAmerican Rescue Plan\nAt the October 18th Town Council meeting, Town Administrator David Deutsch will present early plans on spending the ~2.1 million dollars UP has and will receive from the federal government.\nLeaf Blower Ban\nThe council passed (7-0) the leaf blower ban, with one new amendment. Briefly, as of January 1st, 2024 gas powered leaf blowers cannot be operated in University Park. The companion amendment adds a carrot to the ban (which is the stick). The town will reimburse up to $100 (per household) for an electric-powered yard tool for a three year time period. This program will go in effect in June (?). Details have yet to be worked out for what the fine will be for violoations of the new ordinance.\n2021-10-13 Public Safety Meeting - UP Police Chief Baker in attendance\nSpeed cameras.\n1901 citations written (1656 September alone) so far.\n284 paid.\nMajority are 12-15 mph over the limit.\nAs of 11/1 the council will be asked to amend the town ordinances to allow for 24 hour operation of the speed cameras (only allowed on state roads, so just East-West Highway and Baltimore).\nChief Baker spoke the to Riverdale Park Police Chief about their 20mph residential speed limit. Introduced last year or so. Their chief seems to think it is helpful. Didn’t use a traffic study to justify - had on hand some speed sign and collision data. Essentially their council wanted it. Chief Baker pointed out UP has very few collisions and he is unsure whether a 20mph would have a measureable effect in UP.\n“Smart” Cameras\nChief Baker was interested in a 7 “smart” camera system. Mounted on utility poles. Unobtrusive. Would run at night. Would help the overnight officer automatically identify and alert potential issues. Costs around $60,000. No monthly fees. Chief Baker pointed out that surrounding towns were either running or considering running these systems - in the context of pointing out that thieves are very astute and gravitate to the “easier” areas to “work” in.\nHalloween\nYes, it is happening. October 31. Police will work 5pm - 10pm. The police are aware that out-of-UP people are driving in … and are staying in their car following their kids. The police will encourage everyone to walk for Halloween.\nSignage\nChief would like to add some “no parking, no stopping, no loitering” style signs in some areas as he has had some interactions with out-of-UP people who are … just hanging out in their idling cars.\nNext (public safety committee) meeting\nWill discuss traffic calming measure to consider. Send your input.\n\n\n\n",

Without him, we’d likely have no DOC and thus a much smaller voice in the discussion around the development surrounding us.\nArt in the Park\nInaugural “Art in the Park” will happen this Saturday (9/25) from 1-4 PM in the town playing field. 17 (?) artists will be presenting.\nSpeed camera\nWent “live” on 9/13.

    "contents": "\nOur New Garage\n\n4201 48th Street, Bladensburg, MD\nOne large bay. Enough space for a garbage truck and a pickup truck / car to be worked on simultaneously. Though if the main bay is in use (as it is below), then that red pickup is stuck until the garbage trucks is moved.\n\n~4000 square feet (sq ft) of interior space.\n~1500 sq ft of exterior space\nThe town was paying about $37,000 / year. When the long term lease ended (late 2020/early 2021?) the rate went up to about $44,000 / year. The town also paid the utilities.\nRough timeline.\nRougher because the process began before I was a councilmember.\nLate 2020/Early 2021, the town is informed that the 4201 48th Street garage that UP has been renting for the past ten years will not be available for another lease as the owner plans on selling the property.\nIn March 2021 the council is presented other options. The town of Hyattsville offers up their old garage. At about double our current rate for our existing garage and only offers a short-term lease. Two sites in College Park are modestly larger than the current site, but about 2.5X our current cost. One is substantially smaller and about the same price as we currently pay. The owner of our existing garage informs the town the will sell in about September on the open market, as for $995,000.\nThe town begins an exclusive (one on one) negotiation with the owner of the 4201 48th Street garage\nIn a closed session (June?) we (Mayor and council) are told that the town continues to look for alternative sites (for sale or rent) and has been negotiating back and forth. No good alternatives (within the price/size/distance constrains) have been found. The council urges the administration to work on back up plans should the negotiations fail.\nA few weeks later we are informed a deal has been reached at $825,000.\nThe town is notified in the Town Council meeting and with a flyer about the impending purchase.\nWe learn that we can use American Rescue Plan funds to pay for approximately $375,000 of the cost, meaning no mortage needed to be taken out. The town had already (last fiscal year) allocated $450,000 for the potential purchase.\nSo why are we buying it?\nUP has “in-sourced” the public works operations\nWe own our garage trucks. The garbage trucks are operated and maintained by town staff, including our own mechanic.\nThis requires a garage to maintain / fix our town equipment and the site also serves to store supplies and equipment (the garbage trucks, replacement trash cans, the leaf suckers, extra street signs, etc).\nThis is our best option, buy or rent.\nStoring extra stuffsWhy don’t we just out source the maintenance?\nWell, then we would be reliant on someone else to fix our stuff. In practice our Public Works Director (Michael “Mickey” Beall) has said this means that it can take days / weeks to get repairs done. Which means that the town would have to buy more garbage trucks / etc to cover the extra down time and thus require even more space to store the equipment. Our mechanic works full time to maintain all the town (including the police department) vehicles and equipment.\nIs this is a bad deal?\nIt doesn’t seem like a fabulous deal. I don’t understand the commercial market. We were told that the recent jump in home prices has been matched by the commercial market. Mickey told me he thought this garage was a useful size for many businesses and he wouldn’t expect it be difficult to sell the garage, should the town ever go in a different direction. In the end, this was the best choice available. The good news is that that we used a restricted pot of money to partially pay for it. We also control the site now, so there is reduced risk of “surprise” expenses (remember if we were to rent a different garage our best options looked like they would double our cost). The site has been inspected. The building (except maybe roof) is in good condition. Long term, I think this is a good move. The town is full-in on running the public works in-house and a garage is a core component of that approach.\nSide lot for vehicle parking and storage of goods\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nDanielle Glaros presented on storm water projects:\nPG county has challenging topography for flooding because:\nPoor drainage\nLow lying\nWaterways everywhere\nBecause of this, PG county has stronger storm water management than the state of MD requires. Essentially every new development needs to control 100% of the run off. The MD standard is 50%. However, older developments have zero storm water management.\nOne interesting nugget was that because of these strong regulations new developments reduce the amount of run-off downstream.\nUP has two waterways:\nWells Run\nGuilford Run\n\nShe focused mostly on Wells Run. The 9 Ponds project will likely start within 6 months. Will take about a year to complete. Will be a pond with a path around it. Goal is to make a desireable amenity. Unfortunately trees will be removed to make the pond (designed to retain as many as possible and to replant new ones). The creek upstream of the pond will also be cleaned up to improved flow. Half of water than runs through UP / Wells comes from the PG Mall.Hopefully this will have a large impact for UP.\n\nGuilford Run has some storm water drain work to be done downstream of UP (east of Baltimore).\nMs. Glaros emphasized that water management needed to be managed where it was created. There are no magic bullets. We have to work to control the water we have with rain gardens, reducing impervious surfaces, etc.\nShe is introducing legislation to increase the amount of money the county will reimburse for on-property water control (rain barrels, rain gardens, pervious pavers, etc.).\nAmerican Rescue Plan\nThe town of UP will receive approximately $2.1 million from the US Government over the next two years. The first million will be received very soon. While this is free money it has restrictions on how it can be spent. Very briefly, it can be spent on climate change mitigation (storm water), broadband investments (internet), and COVID-19 mitigation (food banks / small business loans). The town (and committees) are still formulating how the money will be spent. Most of the money will likely go to storm water mitigation. The mayor of UP is looking into hiring a consultant to make a comprehensive Wells Run Watershed (which includes Hyattsville, UP, and Riverdale Park) storm water management plan. The money must be allocated for a project by 12/31/2024 and spent by 12/31/2026.\nWe bought a garage\nThe town of UP is buying the garage that we have leased for the past 11 years. Why? Three reasons:\nThe owner is selling it\nWe are unable to find an equivalent garage within a 20 minute (or even longer….) drive. Much effort was spent trying to “share” garage space with neighboring towns with little effect. The town is a touch salty because we thought we had a deal with Hyattsville….then the terms were changed.\nWe need a garage to fix and store our town equipment (there is a reason you don’t see garbage trucks parked at town hall….)\nThe town administrator (David Deutsch) and the town lawyer (Suellen Ferguson) have been negotiating for months. We have a deal at $825,000. $450,000 was allocated in the last budget for this expense. The remainder will be paid using American Rescue Plan funds, as apparently this is an allowed use of the money.\nThis is good news because:\nWe control a very important piece of infrastructure (a medium-sized garage) that is getting increasingly difficult to procure with the continuous development in the area. We literally were unable to find another equivalent garage (size / location / cost) for lease or sale.\nWe paid “cash” for it and this now frees up about $42,000 / year for the town that was going to the lease.\nWe can always sell it should our needs change\nOur inspections reveal no pollution or structural issues, aside from a leaking roof\nTown Head Notes\nAndrea (town clerk) would really like more town residents to sign up for relevant alerts (e.g. “News and Announcement”). I wrote why you should sign up here.\nDan (Treasurer) briefly summarized the 2020 spending (fiscal year ended 6/31).\nMickey (Public Works) said that the two storm water mini projects (permeable paving at 44th (?) and a rain garden at Claggett/College Heights) were looking great because either one would be enough to meet our PG County requirements. We could save money by doing one or do both and bank extra storm water credits.\nChief Baker had no crime to report. Thanks were given for the UP Town Police’s (and Park Police with their horses) role in the July 4th parade.\n\n\n\n",

New sidewalks being added on College Heights Dr, Clagett, Claggett-Pineway (and other roads off of College Heights Dr). Notably the roads will be narrowed to 26 ft. While not ideal, sidewalks will generally be right next to the road to reduce the number of utility poles that need to be moved and to protect mature trees. While not discussed the “far” side of Clagett-Pineway (closer to College Heights Dr) will likely be narrowed to 24 ft and parking removed from one side to reduce the amount of yard that will be taken, as this portion of Claggett-Pineway is already 26 ft.\nThe town will be hosting the first “Meadow Day” on July 24th!\n\n\n\n",

After all, the town writes and prints a newsletter that comes to your mailbox!\nWell - one important reason: time. The newsletter comes out once a month. Minutes of the town meetings that go into the newsletter have to be approved by the council. Then meet the printing cutoff. So essentially you are reading minutes (“what happened in the room”) that are 4-8 weeks old.\nIf you want to get council matter updates MUCH faster you can go here: https://www.upmd.org/list.aspx\nI suggest you sign up for the “Mayor’s Email List” as Mayor Carey generally sends out a Friday-before-the-Monday-Council-Meeting message that briefly covers what will be discussed at the upcoming meeting. There is always a public comment period near the start of the meeting (7:30 pm) to allow residents to have up to 3 minutes to give their opinion.\n\nIf you have more specific interests (for example “trees”) - you can sign up for Agenda updates for a specific committee like the “Trees, Parks, & Environment Committee”.\n If you want to influence legislation the best time to do it is at the Committee level. By the time a piece of legislation has made its way to the full Town Council the specific committee generally believes it is ready to be approved (otherwise why bother bringing it out?). So thus raising issues before it gets to the full Town Council will be more effective.\nRemember, all council meetings (either Committee or Council) are open to the public. You do not need to ask permission to show up. Depending on the specific Committee you can either take part in the full discussion or will be limited to speaking in the “public comment” portion of the meeting.\n\n\n\n",

But this would maybe save approximately $10,000 of the appoximately $100,000 install cost that we were last quoted. We also would have to restart the permitting process. It wouldn’t be as onerous this time. But still would take more time.\nAny new bridge has to be ADA compliant - so we can’t toss a narrow anything down.\nWe also can’t toss a bridge down like they do in the College Park metal dry ditch pedestrian bridges. Those would lift up and float away if it flooded. Which we know if a fairly likely scenario on Wells. Plus a stream with running water is a substantially more challenging environment for a bridge.\nLonger bridge won’t solve the problem either. The bridge would cost more and the installation cost would not change dramatically.\nBottom line: Mickey has spent 4+ years working on this and believes he has exhausted all angles. The cost is the cost. Essentially the council needs to decide: are these bridge(s) worth 100k each? Do we, as a town, find that a prudent use of our money? Is this something we value? Let me know what you think.\nOriginal post\nBrief stub to explain the current state of the Van Buren / Wells Parkway Pedestrian Bridge. Which Google Maps thinks is doing just fine.\n\nFrom my faulty memory, around 2016 it was pointed out that this bridge was in bad shape. This was confirmed by engineers. In fact, it was in such bad shape there was concern it could collapse. Thus, it was removed.\nPeriodically people (like me) ask “uh, where’s the replacement bridge?”\nHere, I will explain what I understand about this annoying situation.\nThe town bought two wooden bridges. We have them on hand.\nPermitting was required at three levels (Federal, State, and County). The latter was extremely challenging (apparently the bridges were missed in the 1990s era PG County Master Plan).\nAfter huge amounts of town staff time dealing with the three layers of permitting, the town bid the bridge install out. It came out substantially higher (around $110,000) than expected. The council, twice, voted it down.\nSo the bridge replacement process is currently … in bad shape. Maybe even dead.\nPart of the reason that the install was so expensive was the extensive amount of work required to not cause sediment and erosion issues in the stream bed.\nWith all we have learned, we may have to restart the entire process (including the part where we buy some bridges). A longer / larger bridge may cost more, but could save money on the install cost.\n\n\n\n",

There is an extensive amount of public discourse about what the town is doing, will do, and would like to do. This happens at the town meetings.\nImportantly, the notes for the meetings are TEXT SEARCHABLE.\nThe town meetings are of two basic types: town council (1st and 3rd Mondays of each month, beginning at 7:30pm) and committees (each with their own schedule, often monthly). All of these meetings are fully open to the public and as of May 2021 are held exclusively via zoom teleconference.\nA case study\nTo give an example of how to search the town web page to find information on what the town is doing, we will search the term “storm water.”\n\n In the search box you can put in a word or phrase (“storm water”). Then click the magnifying glass (or hit “return” on the keyboard) and you will get the time sorted results, split by section (where section is the specific committee or the town council).\n We see the top three hits (by date) are in the Town Council Meeting and the Development Overview Committee. You can then download either the Agenda (what will be discussed) or the Minutes (a summary of what was discussed).\nIf we download the Mar 11, 2021 minutes we see that the “Aspen, College Park” development has a preliminary plan of subdivision that has been approved and “Nick Speech talked about the re-engineering of the project’s stormwater handling. The County will not accept a fee in-lieu for stormwater management. They have included vaults to hold stormwater under each of the 2 buildings…”\n\n\n\n",

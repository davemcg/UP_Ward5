As I understand there is no ADA accessibility, mold issues, and insufficient space for the public works employees. The lot that the building is on is challenging to work with as it is not flat and the metro system has a tunnel running underneath it.\n2019\nThe town council in 2019 commissioned a town hall renovation study from Arnold & Arnold. You can read it here. The price is … a lot. 4.2 - 4.7 is more than our yearly budget. Now, that is not how things are paid for (UP would likely take out a 30 year bond), but still. That is a lot of money. My understanding is that the public works committee is essentially starting over on the project as the needs have changed with the pandemic.\n2009\nJohn Tabori mentioned to me that in 2009 he commissioned a town hall renovation report from Ahman. From his memory he thought it would have cost about 2.4 million. Which had to be shelved as the 2008 recession disappeared all of the grant money the town was expecting. I’m currently (2021-05-10) trying to get access to this study.\n… later that day …\nAndrea found the reports. Here and here are the two PDFs she tracked down.\nDramatically oversimplifying the two (2009 and 2019) studies, I would say that the scope increased from 2009 to 2019. The 2009 plan essentially leaves the original building layout the same (but presumably fixed it up?), builds a small “transition” section whose purpose is to 1. hold an elevator to reach the second floor of the original Town Hall and 2. connect to the new building. The new building is a one story structure that holds a 1. large meeting room, 2. two offices, and 3. a kitchen.\nThe 2019 plan involves two new buildings. Obviously costs from 2009 won’t match 2019, but the extra building (and increased footprint) very roughly increases the building cost by one million and the property grading work by another million. Hence 2009 is approximately $2.3 and 2019 is approximately $4.5 million.\n2019 Concept 1, Option A\n\n2009\n\n\n(There’s no equivalent to the image above in the 2019 study)\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nNote\nSee the bottom of this post for updates\nWard 5 Flooding “Hot Spots”\nWard 5 floods periodically. Not in the “traditional” sense, but because occasionally it rains so hard that the storm drain system cannot keep up. The problem spot is roughly between Pineway (at Clagett-Pineway) through the empty lot near 6924 Pineway, where it heads towards Guilford Run\nFloodfactor.com\n\nPerspective\nWhile this nice map shows us where the issues are in Ward 5, the surrounding region has FAR WORSE problems (e.g. Riverdale Park below Whole Foods and lower/east Calvert Hills)\n\nUP Role - April 2021\nFrom a conversation with Len Carey in April 2021, I learned that UP had recently discovered that some of the storm water piping was substandard and not under the control of PG County. Should the town be able to upgrade the piping, then responsibility of the storm drains can be transferred (town wide?) to PG County See the image below for the approximate location of the substandard piping. The storm drain here (Pineway at Clagett-Pineway) regularly drains very slowly under heavy rains. I would imagine that fixing the pipe here would fix this issue.\n\nDownstream\nFrom my own experience, under VERY (as in 2+ inches/hour) heavy rain events, Guilford Run can get backed up and the storm drains stop taking in water (or perhaps even go backwards….). This is likely because the pipe underneath Baltimore isn’t large enough. For the Ward 5 storm flooding issues to be aleviated, this also would need to be addressed (I assume with a Guilford Run holding tank and/or better flow underneath Route 1).\n2021 05 Update\nThanks for Carter for pointing this document / plan out. There has been a great deal of planning to deal with Guilford Run -> Calvert Hills already. With a fair amount of money spent, according to this document. However, the bulk of the project remains to be done.\n\nI’m not certain at what level (College Park / PG County / Higher?) this is being run at. I also need to figure out what the current status of the project is. Should “they” move this more to completion, it would benefit the Pineway/Ward 5 stretch.\n2021-06-07 Update\nSome new comments after talking with UP Public Works Director Mickey Beall.\nThe town owns seven sections of storm drains. Mickey does not want to own them. He recently had to spend $1800 to unplug one. His budget is not sufficiently flush enough to withstand too many of these surprises. No more sanitation puns I promise.\nIf we can bring the storm drains up to PG County (not WSSC, I was wrong) standard, we can give them over and then it is their problem. Bad news, is that this requires a lot of planning, permitting, and destruction / construction. Good news is that Mickey has already started on the planning and the costs will be 100% reimbursed by the county after we complete the updates.\nThe town will continue to flood until improvements are made outside our town. When 9 Ponds is done (within a couple of years?) this alone will reduce the Wells Run flood level by several inches.\nIn Ward 5, Mickey confirmed our flooding is caused by Guilford Run backing up. Mickey said that Pineway at Clagett-Pineway is only about a foot higher than Guilford. So we need the Calvert Hill project to be implemented. Mickey said he thought they were supposed to start this summer. Emphasis on supposed to.\nBottom line - anyone who has flooded in the near term should expect a repeat\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nFree as in beer\nIn case you were not aware, the town is providing free EV charging at UPES. Why? Let me explain.\nThe charger hardware was free (literally free)\nThe town did have to pay to upgrade the electrical infrastructure to support the chargers\nSo there was not huge outlay of money to provide the chargers at UPES.\nWe are not charging for the electricity for the following reasons:\nIt is not a noticeable amount of cost to the town*\nWe generate a lot of power from the solar panels at UPES - so it may cost the town even less than I estimate below\nThe chargers encourage EV adoption (residents have stated they felt more comfortable buying an EV as they knew they had somewhere safe and convenient to charge)\nCharging for charging costs money (administrative overhead, setting up a payment system, credit card fees, etc)\nThat said, if the cost becomes an issue, we can re-visit the payment question.\n* Napkin math. Pepco charges my house about $0.15 for 1 kWh. One charger outputs around* 4 kW per hour. So 4 * 0.15 ~ $0.60 for one hour of charging. If all eight chargers were in use 24/7/365 this would cost $40,000 a year. Now, that is not the reality. I bike past UPES all the time and the most cars I’ve ever seen charging at a time is about six. Usually 0-1. The town administrator has been asked what this is costing the town and his impression is that this is “not a noticeable amount of money.”\nbased on me looking at some chargers in use\nNew town administrator\nWe don’t have one yet. The town/Mayor is trying to get a new one as quickly as possible to reduce the gap between the outgoing and incoming administrator. Mr. Deutsch, as of 12/16, has retired from his position. He will not stay past that date (we have asked). This was supposed to be a six month job for him, and he is now 2+ years into the position. The position has been advertised and the Mayor will put forward a candidate. The council’s role will be to vote up/down the hiring of the candidate. Interviews are being scheduled with the six or seven candidates. Council members are encouraged to attend the interviews.\nStormwater system update\nThere are two parallel tracks of stormwater planning in town. This is in reference to the “county acceptance” stormwater issue where certain parts of the town’s stormwater system are “substandard” and need to be improved to get the county to assume responsibility. This will, eventually, cost the town about $0. But it involves a lot of paperwork, planning, and inflow of money. The Soltesz firm recently has returned the preliminary plan for the updates, which has be sent to the county to begin to bureaucratic process. It is budget time at the county and we are hoping that the county will put the cost of the program (1.7 million dollars worth) into next year’s budget. Micey has spoken to the county level contacts and they seem (so far) cooperative (as in they don’t seem confused and dismayed at our actions so far).\nThe largest expense, by far, is under Clagett-Pineway. The new system will involve 72 inch diameter pipes (which would be the largest in town) and run the entire length of Clagett-Pineway (currently the system starts at Clagett-Pineway / Clagett).\nClagett-Pineway has flooded several times in the past few years and this flooding has resulted in basement inundation for several Ward 5 residents. The town is fully committed, from the Mayor on down, to updating the system with all haste. We cannot promise that these fixes alone will solve the flash flooding, but this is the first step.\nPolice Requests\nBig one\nThis is a big ask and I would appreciate your comments: Chief Baker wants to place 12 “smart” video cameras at major entry points in town. He is concerned about incidents being caused by non-resident pedestrians. The police have very little information after incidents occur (thankfully most are fairly minor - like package theft) and the county police has no interest in investigating if there isn’t any concrete evidence. UMD and Hyattsville are using similar camera systems.\nThe Chief views the camera system as a police “multiplier” as it will allow for the overnight officers to get automatic alerts if movement is detected and will help in investigating incidents.\nSome details:\nExterior focus (not monitoring “in town” movement)\nData is held on-site in town hall. Deleted after 30 days.\nThere will be a written policy governing usage\nInitial cost: $180,000 (Chief Baker has applied for a $100,000 grant to defray the cost)\nRecurring cost: ~$12,000/year\nPolice will not monitor the video (live or otherwise). The video will only be used in two ways:\nauto-movement alerts at night (so police are aware of unusual activity during the overnight shifts)\nreviewed after a crime has occurred\n\nIf homes are in view of the cameras, the residents will be contacted and offered the option of having a digital “mask” applied over their home.\nI’m of two minds: 1. this will make the police substantially more efficient and more capable to quickly respond to incidents (especially at night) and 2. I’m concerned about the privacy implications. The cameras are essentially placed at all egress points in town and so your movements are being recorded as your leave town. The Chief points out that cameras like these are EVERYWHERE so the panopticon being proposed is already in place all around us. But still, the libertarian in me is a bit uneasy. I am happy to see that the video is being permanently deleted after 30 days - this removes a lot of my imaginary issues.\nSmaller one\nThe next ask is a retention bonus for the officers. This will cost about $40,000 in total. Eligible officers will get up to $5,000. If they accept the bonus they must stay on the UP force for three years (or they have to pay back the bonus). Police staffing is especially difficult and just about every “competing” police force is offering large bonuses. Chief Baker states this is not intended to be a yearly occurence. I plan on supporting this request.\nTreasurer\nDan Baden will be retiring end of this year. We will advertise the position and work on hiring another treasurer. From what I’ve been told we have a separated book-keeper, so regular payment and payroll actions will not be affected.\nCode Compliance\nWe have had a new officer (John Rodgers) for about three months. The outgoing town administrator says he has been doing a good job so far. Remember, if there are any complaints regarding property maintenance, they can be routed to him.\nStay safe and happy holidays!\nPlease consider masking inside - the kids are getting ravaged with various diseases (I think my daughter’s K class was 30% absent last Friday).\n\n\n\n",

The idea is to get a better understanding of the issue. “Notes” are one-off short postings on a variety of topics.\nPosts are be written by the Ward 5 Councilmember, David McGaughey. I welcome content / suggestions from you all.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nUP Ward 5 Candidate Statement\nHello, my name is David McGaughey. Jaime and I live (with our two daughters) at 6924 Pineway. I am running for the UP Ward 5 council member seat and wanted to introduce myself, explain the main issues I think the town should be concerned about, and my positions on them.\nAbout me and my family\nI work as a scientist doing DNA sequence and “big data” analysis for the NIH in Bethesda. Jaime and I have lived in UP since September 2009. We have two kids, a 1st grader at UPES and a preschooler who, pre-COVID, was at Greenwood Daycare. Even if you don’t know me, you probably have seen me, as I’m the guy on that huge blue cargo bike (often with two kids riding on the back). I post on the listserv occasionally: I wrote a MD COVID tracker by zip code (davemcg.com/zip_level) and, in 2018, posted about running a traffic counter though my window.\nCommunication\nIt is important for the residents of each Ward to understand what their council representative is thinking on critical issues. Should I be elected, I plan to regularly write about my thoughts on the important town issues on davemcg.com. I hope my transparency and direct communication will improve our residents’ understanding of how the council serves UP.\nTraffic\nThis is probably a major issue for any neighborhood in / near a city. Residents are, rightfully, concerned about stop sign running, parked cars getting clipped, overflow from rush hour, cut-through traffic, and speeding. As I see it, the town currently uses a few levers to control traffic:\nPolice enforcement (I personally feel like telling the police to “work harder” won’t be very effective)\nStop signs (this avenue has been exhausted as I think nearly every intersection has one now, including several that flash)\nSpeed humps (these are NOT effective in my opinion, though more severe speed bumps could be)\n“Your current speed” signs\nThe roads are not just for the cars to drive on. We walk and run on them. We would like our children to be able to safely cross them. We want to enjoy our sidewalks without cars zooming by. We want our children to be able to ride bikes on our roads.\nAs this is a universal issue there are many resources discussing ways to control traffic:\nhttp://www.virginiadot.org/programs/resources/Traffic-Calming-Guide-For-Neighborhood-Streets.pdf\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/mission/health/Traffic-Calming-to-Slow-Vehicle-Speeds\nI would like the town to consider using a larger array of means to influence vehicle speeds. Personally, I’m very interested in chicanes, which are essentially permanently parked cars. As many of us are already parking our cars on our roads, this shouldn’t be a particularly substantial change. In areas where people report their cars regularly getting clipped, this will force better behavior.\nYou may remember I posted on the list-serve in 2018 about a raspberry-pi system to automatically count cars. This system counted nearly a thousand cars each day going past my house (with substantial directionality - cars went towards Baltimore in the morning and towards Adelphi in the afternoon). This suggests a substantial amount of thru-traffic. I would love if the town could implement some kind of cheap (!) monitoring solution in the town infrastructure so we can quantify our traffic volume and create a data-driven plan to correct the problems.\nStorm drains / “why won’t the water go away”\nI have personally seen my own yard and the adjacent empty lot go underwater 3 times in the past 10 years by storm drains going backwards due to uncontrollable water volumes. The issues we currently have with water are substantially impacted by issues outside our town. The culverts are too small underneath Baltimore Ave and development on all sides is paving over permeable land. The town will continue to need to be vigilant in pushing for aggressive storm water control measures for any new developments (like the one UMD is proposing just north of College Heights Estates) and advocating for downstream improvements at the county level. With the Cafritz (Whole Foods) development I understand the town played an important role in forcing the developer to dramatically expand their storm drain holding capacity.\nThe new Town Hall\nThe current office space at Town Hall is very constrained for our town employees and there is no communal space for town council meetings. This isn’t ideal. However, spending several million dollars on a town hall seems way beyond our means. We either need a more economical option or to continue on the current path (meetings at UPES and an old house for the employees). Could we lease space elsewhere or plan to build something cheaper? $3,000,000 / 900 households is approximately $3,300 per household. If indeed the mayor and a majority of the council want to approve this expenditure, I think this kind of spending would warrant a town referendum. I personally would vote against a town hall as currently proposed.\nTown Manager\nI think the town owes us a compelling argument on why we should add another employee (and a relatively expensive one) to our payroll. While other towns around us have a town manager / administrator, UP is also substantially smaller. The current approach appears to be gently “easing one in” by making it a part-time position. I think the messaging has been poor as the mayor and town council seem to have reduced the argument to “yes we need one; it is very helpful and we are doing it.” Again, $150,000 / 900 is $167 per household. Do we get $167 of value in another employee? My starting position on this matter is “no, why do we need to spend $167 per household” on an employee who is overlapping the responsibilities of the mayor and council. I need to be convinced.\nClosing\nThanks for reading my opinions on these matters. We have lived in UP for over ten years. We love biking and walking through our beautiful town, the bike and walking paths that connect us to our neighboring towns, the many mature trees covering our town, and our neighbors. I hope we can continue to work to make our streets safer for our children (and our street-parked cars), improve the storm drainage throughout our town, and carefully and responsibily spend our town resident’s money.\n\n\n\n",

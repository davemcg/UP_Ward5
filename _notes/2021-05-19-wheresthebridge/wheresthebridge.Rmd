Had a brief discussion with [Mickey Beall](https://www.upmd.org/directory.aspx?EID=18) (UP public works director). 

Here are my notes from our chat:

1. There is a new idea how to save money on the install (essentially drill a support instead of pouring a large foundation). **But** this would **maybe** save approximately $10,000 of the appoximately $100,000 install cost that we were last quoted. We also would have to restart the permitting process. It wouldn't be as onerous this time. But still would take more time. 
2. Any new bridge has to be ADA compliant - so we can't toss a narrow anything down.
3. We also can't toss a bridge down like they do in the College Park metal dry ditch pedestrian bridges. Those would lift up and float away if it flooded. Which we *know* if a fairly likely scenario on Wells. Plus a stream with running water is a substantially more challenging environment for a bridge.
4. Longer bridge won't solve the problem either. The bridge would cost more and the installation cost would not change dramatically. 

Bottom line: Mickey has spent 4+ years working on this and believes he has exhausted all angles. The cost is the cost. Essentially the council needs to decide: are these bridge(s) *worth* 100k each? Do we, as a town, find that a prudent use of our money? Is this something we value? Let me know what you think. 

# Original post

Brief stub to explain the current state of the Van Buren / Wells Parkway Pedestrian Bridge. Which Google Maps thinks is doing just fine.

From my faulty memory, around 2016 it was pointed out that this bridge was in bad shape. This was confirmed by engineers. In fact, it was in such bad shape there was concern it could collapse. Thus, it was removed.

Periodically people (like me) ask "uh, where's the replacement bridge?" 

Here, I will explain what I understand about this annoying situation.

1. The town bought two wooden bridges. We have them on hand.
2. Permitting was required at three levels (Federal, State, and County). The latter was extremely challenging (apparently the bridges were missed in the 1990s era PG County Master Plan).
3. After huge amounts of town staff time dealing with the three layers of permitting, the town bid the bridge install out. It came out substantially higher (around $110,000) than expected. The council, twice, voted it down. 

So the bridge replacement process is currently ... in bad shape. Maybe even dead. 

Part of the reason that the install was so expensive was the extensive amount of work required to not cause sediment and erosion issues in the stream bed. 

With all we have learned, we may have to restart the entire process (including the part where we buy some bridges). A longer / larger bridge may cost more, but could save money on the install cost.

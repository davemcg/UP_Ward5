# 2022-03-07 Town Council

## Mayor Notes:
  - 3/30 the Hyattsville Library ribbon cutting!

  - UPCA is alive and is seeking event chairs and a president

  - 4/2 is the UPCA Yard Sale

  - Mayor has asked staff to open Town Hall to the public in the Spring.
  
  - In person council meetings with Zoom? Probably would happen with the incoming Mayor. Town Attorney Ferguson points out we can’t use the 2nd floor of town hall as not ADA compliant (Zoom doesn’t count).
  
## Biermann Notes:

  - Sustainability committee looking into making UP:
    - Monarch Waystation
    - Bee City
    - More pollinator spaces
    - Advertising “No Mow May”

  - April 23rd: 10am Town Stream Clean (Town Field)
  - June 25th: Meadow Day 10-12
  - Town Park Plan RFP: Make a timeline to finish comments

## Mickey Beall:

  He explained the council should allocate another **$300,000** or so to finish the town infrastructure project.
  
  Money was allocated for this project 3 years ago. Over the past three years, a few changes have happened that have increased the price tag:

  - Expanded scope of sidewalk repair to take advantage (~ 350 homes) of cheaper original pricing 
  - Permitting is increasingly a challenge. The original hope was that the town would get approval to finish "Phase 2B" in October 2021. The town is **still** waiting for approval. 
    
  In the end the \$2.6 million dollar project (original budget) is now \$2.9 million. So there is a $329,292 overage from the original allocation from 3 years ago. In money term, about \$100,000 is from doing extra work (fixing more trip hazard sidewalks) and about \$200,000 is from increased costs of construction (inflation, essentially). 
  
  The town will likely use our reserve to pay for the overage
  
  The bridge (near UP Elementary) will also get some cracks repaired. It has 10 years of deferred repairs and the Town thinks this is important we should get it done. While removing this from the construction would save \$100,000 in the near term, I don't like to idea of kicking the can of bridge repair down the road any further.
  
  The council passed this request 6-0. Yes, paying more is highly annoying, especially as a lot of the fault seems to lie with the county level permitting process being slow. But given the rampant inflation we are living through, this is (in my opinion), a not-crazy cost overage. These repairs will put the town in a good position over the next decade and beyond, I hope.
  
# Public Safety Subcommittee Meeting (2021-03-09)

Just some quick costs that Mickey gave for various road "features." Useful numbers to have in mind when thinking about requesting improvements to your own street:

  - \$14000 for a table top sidewalk
  - \$3500 speed bump
  - \$1000 blinking stop sign
  - \$5000 blinking speed sign
  - \$8000 blinking crosswalk (example in front of UP Elementary)
  - \$80 stop bar (the white line at each stop sign) 
  
We on the public safety committee will ask the full town council to adopt a *town wide* 20 mph speed limit. 

# DOC (2021-03-10)

JC Penny at PG Plaza Mall getting turned into an apartment building. The developer will also extend Toledo Road through to Toledo Terrace (when you cross into the mall it isn't really a road....just a mall parking lot exterior lane thing). I asked the committee to recommend that the full UP Town Council formally ask for protected bike lanes as the developer was proposing just putting some paint on the road for a bike lane. As I believe they are rebuilding Toledo Road, it seems like a missed opportunity. We are also going to ask for details on storm water management (their engineer was not on the call).

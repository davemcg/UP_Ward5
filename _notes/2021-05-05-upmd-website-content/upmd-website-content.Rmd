The [upmd.org](https://www.upmd.org) web page is a great resource for getting a wide variety of town info. There is an extensive amount of public discourse about what the town is doing, will do, and would like to do. This happens at the town meetings. 

Importantly, the notes for the meetings are **TEXT SEARCHABLE**.

The town meetings are of two basic types: [town council](https://www.upmd.org/198/Town-Council) (1st and 3rd Mondays of each month, beginning at 7:30pm) and [committees](https://www.upmd.org/185/Committees-Commissions) (each with their own schedule, often monthly). **All of these meetings are fully open to the public** and as of May 2021 are held exclusively via zoom teleconference.

We see the top three hits (by date) are in the Town Council Meeting and the Development Overview Committee. You can then download either the Agenda (what *will* be discussed) or the Minutes (a summary of what *was* discussed).

If we download the Mar 11, 2021 minutes we see that the "Aspen, College Park" development has a preliminary plan of subdivision that has been approved and "Nick Speech talked about the re-engineering of the projectâ€™s stormwater handling. The County will not accept a fee in-lieu for stormwater management. They have included vaults to hold stormwater under each of the 2 buildings..."
